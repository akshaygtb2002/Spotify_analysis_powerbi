# 🎧 Spotify Music Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)

An interactive dashboard created in **Power BI** to explore and visualize streaming data on Spotify — focusing on total plays, top artists, audio features, and listening trends over time.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

With millions of tracks and artists on Spotify, analyzing user listening behavior and identifying streaming trends across different time periods can be overwhelming. Users and analysts often need insights into:

- Which tracks and artists are most streamed?
- What are the audio characteristics of popular music?
- How do listening patterns vary by day or month?

Traditional data tables don’t effectively capture or present this type of analysis.
